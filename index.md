## About Me
 Hi, I am a passionate learner, and love solving real world problems that are not only challenging but also require thorough understanding. The recent advances in technology excite me, especially in the areas of robotics and all other fields that overlap with it, like Natural language processing and computer vision. I would love to explore these fields further.

<br />
  Team Leader and Computer Vision Head, Team IGVC, IIT Kanpur <br />
  Sept 2016 – April 2017 | Dr Gaurav Pandey, EE, IIT Kanpur
   * Built and tested numerous computer vision algorithms to detect chalk lanes on grassy surface and avoid obstacles using sensors like LIDAR and Camera.
   * Created a system for online mapping of surroundings (lanes and obstacles) using continuous LIDAR and camera data stream.
   * Used multiple sensors like GPS, IMU and encoders for robot pose estimation and control <br />
